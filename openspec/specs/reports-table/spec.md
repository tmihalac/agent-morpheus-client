# reports-table Specification

## Purpose
The reports table displays vulnerability analysis reports in a tabular format, allowing users to view SBOM report-level analysis results. The table provides aggregate ExploitIQ status indicators that summarize the overall vulnerability posture of each SBOM report.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Reports Table Display
The reports table SHALL support sorting by the following columns:
- **SBOM Name**: Sortable (maps to product name)
- **CVE ID**: Sortable (maps to product CVE ID)
- **Date Requested**: Sortable (maps to submittedAt timestamp)
- **Date Completed**: Sortable (maps to completedAt timestamp)

**Note**: Report ID column is NOT sortable - it is displayed as a clickable link for navigation purposes only.
 When every component is excluded (`submissionFailures.length` equals `submittedCount`), `completedAt` SHALL be set when the last submission failure is recorded so Date Completed is not empty.

#### Scenario: Default sorting by submittedAt
- **WHEN** a user first views the reports table
- **THEN** the table is sorted by submittedAt in descending order (newest products first, oldest products last) using server-side sorting
- **AND** the sorting is performed by the `/api/v1/reports/product` API endpoint with `sortField=submittedAt` and `sortDirection=DESC`
- **AND** the SBOM Name, CVE ID, Date Requested, and Date Completed columns are sortable by the user (ascending/descending)
- **AND** the Report ID column is NOT sortable (it is a clickable link for navigation only)

### Requirement: Reports Table Filtering

The reports table SHALL support filtering by SBOM Name and CVE ID. All filtering SHALL be performed server-side via the `/api/v1/reports/product` API endpoint. Filter state SHALL be persisted in the browser URL as query parameters to enable shareable links. The active filter attribute (which search/filter input is displayed) SHALL remain unchanged until the user manually changes it.

#### Scenario: SBOM Name text search filter
- **WHEN** a user enters text in the SBOM Name search field
- **THEN** the filter value is sent to `/api/v1/reports/product` as `name` query parameter
- **AND** the API performs case-insensitive partial text matching on product name field
- **AND** products matching the search text are displayed in the table
- **AND** partial matches are supported (e.g., searching "test" matches "test-product" and "my-test-product")

#### Scenario: CVE ID text search filter
- **WHEN** a user enters text in the CVE ID search field
- **THEN** the filter value is sent to `/api/v1/reports/product` as `cveId` query parameter
- **AND** the API performs exact matching on CVE ID field
- **AND** products with matching CVE IDs are displayed in the table

#### Scenario: Filter combination
- **WHEN** a user applies multiple filters simultaneously
- **THEN** all active filters are combined with AND logic
- **AND** products matching all filter criteria are displayed
- **AND** filter parameters are sent together in a single API request

#### Scenario: Clear filters
- **WHEN** a user clicks "Clear all filters"
- **THEN** all filter values are reset to empty/default
- **AND** the URL query parameters are removed
- **AND** the table displays all products (unfiltered)

#### Scenario: Filter state in URL
- **WHEN** a user applies filters to the reports table
- **THEN** the filter values are stored as query parameters in the browser URL (e.g., `/reports?name=test&cveId=CVE-2024`)
- **AND** the URL can be shared with others to view the same filtered results
- **AND** when navigating back to the reports page, the filter state is restored from URL parameters
- **AND** filter parameters are combined with sort parameters in the URL

#### Scenario: Filter persistence across navigation
- **WHEN** a user applies filters and then navigates away from the reports page
- **AND** the user navigates back to the reports page
- **THEN** the filter state is restored from URL query parameters
- **AND** the table displays the filtered results matching the restored filter state

#### Scenario: Pagination reset on filter change
- **WHEN** a user changes any filter value
- **THEN** the pagination is reset to page 1
- **AND** the filtered results are displayed starting from the first page

#### Scenario: Active filter attribute persistence
- **WHEN** a user selects a filter attribute (e.g., "SBOM Name" or "CVE ID") from the attribute selector
- **AND** the user applies a filter value
- **THEN** the active filter attribute remains set to the selected attribute (e.g., "SBOM Name")
- **AND** the same filter input remains displayed even after the filter is applied
- **AND** the active attribute only changes when the user manually selects a different attribute from the attribute selector

#### Scenario: Live refresh behavior
- **WHEN** a user views the reports table
- **THEN** the table refreshes when the server pushes SSE catalog events (see `report-events-stream` and `api-hooks` specifications)
- **AND** the refresh preserves current pagination, sorting, and filter settings
- **AND** live-update invalidation uses `LiveUpdatesProvider` and `liveUpdatesRefresh` (see `api-hooks` and `report-events-stream`)

### Requirement: Optimized Single Report Navigation
When a product has exactly one submitted report (`submittedCount === 1`), clicking on the Report ID in the reports table SHALL query the reports API for that product and navigate directly to the single report page at `/reports/component/:reportId/:cveId`, bypassing the product summary page. If the product has more than one submitted report, the system SHALL navigate to the product summary page at `/reports/product/:productId/:cveId` (current behavior).

#### Scenario: Direct navigation for single report product
- **WHEN** a user clicks on a Report ID in the reports table
- **AND** the product has `submittedCount === 1`
- **THEN** the system queries the `/api/v1/reports` API endpoint with `productId` filter parameter
- **AND** a loading state indicator is displayed while the query is in progress
- **AND** upon successful response, the system takes the first report from the results
- **AND** the system navigates directly to `/reports/component/:reportId/:cveId` where `reportId` is the ID of the first report and `cveId` is the CVE ID from the product row
- **AND** the user sees the repository report page without an intermediate product summary page

#### Scenario: Standard navigation for multiple report product
- **WHEN** a user clicks on a Report ID in the reports table
- **AND** the product has `submittedCount > 1` or `submittedCount` is undefined/null
- **THEN** the system navigates to the product summary page at `/reports/product/:productId/:cveId` (current behavior)
- **AND** no reports API query is performed

#### Scenario: Error handling for single report navigation
- **WHEN** a user clicks on a Report ID in the reports table
- **AND** the product has `submittedCount === 1`
- **AND** the reports API query fails (network error, 500 error, etc.)
- **THEN** the system falls back to the standard navigation behavior
- **AND** the system navigates to the product summary page at `/reports/product/:productId/:cveId`
- **AND** the error is handled gracefully without displaying an error message to the user (silent fallback)

#### Scenario: Edge case handling for empty results
- **WHEN** a user clicks on a Report ID in the reports table
- **AND** the product has `submittedCount === 1`
- **AND** the reports API query succeeds but returns zero reports
- **THEN** the system falls back to the standard navigation behavior
- **AND** the system navigates to the product summary page at `/reports/product/:productId/:cveId`

#### Scenario: Loading state during single report query
- **WHEN** a user clicks on a Report ID in the reports table
- **AND** the product has `submittedCount === 1`
- **AND** the reports API query is in progress
- **THEN** a PatternFly `Spinner` component with `size="sm"` is displayed inline within the Report ID Link component
- **AND** the Spinner replaces the Report ID text in the same table cell (first column, same row)
- **AND** the Link component remains in the same position and maintains its clickable area styling
- **AND** the loading indicator is visible until the query completes or fails
- **AND** the loading indicator is removed once navigation occurs or the fallback behavior is triggered
- **AND** only the clicked row shows the loading indicator (other rows remain unchanged)

### Requirement: Reports Table Finding Column
The reports table SHALL display a "Finding" column with one finding per product. If any component report is still in pending, queued, or sent state, the Finding SHALL be "In progress" until every component has a terminal outcome (completed, failed, expired, or excluded). After that, six outcomes apply in priority order: Vulnerable > Uncertain > Failed > Excluded > Not vulnerable. Only the single applicable finding is shown per row. Counts for Vulnerable, Uncertain, and Excluded only; no count for In progress, Not vulnerable, or Failed.

#### Scenario: Finding column header
- **WHEN** a user views the reports table
- **THEN** the column header is "Finding" with a help icon and popover explaining priority and states

#### Scenario: Finding by priority
- **WHEN** a product has any report in pending, queued, or sent state → display "In progress", no count, outlined grey label and InProgressIcon (even if some other repositories already have a vulnerable or uncertain result)
- **WHEN** no reports are pending, queued, or sent, and the product has one or more vulnerable repositories → display "Vulnerable" + count, red (danger) label
- **WHEN** no reports are pending, queued, or sent, zero vulnerable, and one or more uncertain → display "Uncertain" + count, orange (warning) label
- **WHEN** no reports are pending, queued, or sent, zero vulnerable, zero uncertain, no failed/expired reports, and one or more excluded components (`statusCounts["excluded"]` > 0) → display "Excluded" + count, with label styling as defined (e.g. grey or info)
- **WHEN** no reports are pending, queued, or sent, 100% of reports are completed and 100% are not vulnerable and no excluded components → display "Not vulnerable", no count, green (success) label

#### Scenario: Excluded state uses submission failure count
- **WHEN** a product has excluded components (submissionFailures length > 0) and no higher-priority finding
- **THEN** the Finding column displays "Excluded" with the count equal to `statusCounts["excluded"]` (length of product submissionFailures)
- **AND** the count is shown in the same format as Vulnerable and Uncertain (e.g. "3 Excluded")

### Requirement: Reports Page Tabs and Single Repositories
The Reports page SHALL display two tabs: **SBOMs** (default) and **Single Repositories**. Selecting a tab SHALL switch content and update the URL: `/reports` for SBOMs, `/reports/single-repositories` for Single Repositories. Direct navigation to either URL SHALL show the corresponding tab. Spacing between tab bar and content SHALL use PatternFly Stack/StackItem with the standard spacer.

#### Scenario: Tabs and URL
- **WHEN** a user is on the Reports page
- **THEN** two tabs are shown; SBOMs tab shows the product-level reports table (filtering, sorting, pagination as in Reports Table Display/Filtering); Single Repositories tab shows a table of reports without `report.metadata.product_id`
- **AND** clicking a tab navigates to its URL; browser Back/Forward SHALL switch tabs correctly

#### Scenario: Single Repositories table
- **WHEN** the Single Repositories tab is active
- **THEN** a table is shown that conforms to the **repository-reports-table** specification (columns, Finding column logic, shared InProgressStatus/FailedStatus, single Finding filter, pagination, loading and empty/error behavior)
- **AND** data is from `/api/v1/reports` with a parameter returning only reports where `report.metadata.product_id` is absent; pagination, sorting, and filtering are server-side
- **AND** "View" navigates to `/reports/component/:cveId/:reportId`; empty and error states are displayed when applicable

#### Scenario: Implementation and test data
- **WHEN** implementing the feature
- **THEN** Single Repositories tab content SHALL live in a dedicated component (e.g. `SingleRepositoriesTable.tsx`) reusing patterns from `RepositoryReportsTable`
- **AND** devservices/test data SHALL include at least one report without `report.metadata.product_id` (e.g. under `src/test/resources/devservices/reports/`) for verification

### Requirement: Repos Analyzed column format
The reports table SHALL display the "Repos Analyzed" column using the same calculation as the report page Details card: num completed from `statusCounts["completed"]` and num submitted from `product.data.submittedCount`. The display SHALL use the same shared formatter as the report details card, with the optional suffix "analyzed" (e.g. "5/10 analyzed").

#### Scenario: Repos Analyzed uses completed and submittedCount
- **WHEN** a user views the reports table
- **THEN** the Repos Analyzed column shows values in the form {completed}/{submitted} with the suffix "analyzed" (e.g. "5/10 analyzed")
- **AND** completed is the value of `statusCounts["completed"]` (or 0 if absent)
- **AND** submitted is the value of `product.data.submittedCount`
- **AND** the same shared formatting logic is used as for the report page Details card (with suffix enabled for the table)

### Requirement: Reports Toolbar Per-Page Selection
When the reports table toolbar is used with pagination, the toolbar SHALL accept optional `perPageOptions` and `onPerPageSelect` and SHALL pass them to the PatternFly Pagination component. When provided, the user SHALL be able to select a different page size from the options; selecting a new per-page value SHALL invoke the caller's handler so pagination state (e.g. page and perPage) can be updated (typically resetting to page 1).

#### Scenario: Per-page options displayed and selectable
- **WHEN** the reports toolbar is rendered with pagination and `perPageOptions` (e.g. 10, 20, 50, 100) and `onPerPageSelect` are provided
- **THEN** the Pagination component displays a per-page dropdown with the given options
- **AND** when the user selects a new per-page value, `onPerPageSelect` is called with the new value so the caller can update state and refetch

#### Scenario: Backward compatibility when options not provided
- **WHEN** the reports toolbar is rendered with pagination but `perPageOptions` or `onPerPageSelect` are omitted
- **THEN** the Pagination component still renders with page navigation (onSetPage)
- **AND** the per-page control may show no options or a default so existing callers do not break

### Requirement: SBOMs table rows match analysis lifecycle

The SBOMs tab product-level reports table SHALL list only products that correspond to vulnerability analysis work the user can reason about: either at least one report exists for the product batch **or** the product summary supports the Finding column rules without an undefined outcome. Rows SHALL NOT represent submissions that failed with an HTTP error **before** a report was persisted and queued for that attempt (for example a CycloneDX upload that returns HTTP 400 after parse for SBOM validation). The Finding column SHALL NOT remain permanently empty for any row returned by the listing API after a refresh.

#### Scenario: Failed CycloneDX upload does not add an SBOMs row

- **WHEN** a user submits CycloneDX from the request analysis flow and the server responds with HTTP 400 (or another error) for that submission without creating a queued or completed report for that product
- **THEN** after the reports list refreshes (including SSE-driven refresh), the SBOMs table SHALL NOT show a new product row that exists only because of that failed submission
- **AND** the user does not see a row with an empty Finding and no navigable report for that attempt

#### Scenario: Legitimate processing shows In progress, not blank

- **WHEN** a product row is returned for an accepted analysis batch where reports exist and the Finding rules classify the batch as still in progress (including edge cases where summary state is processing but individual status keys are not yet populated)
- **THEN** the Finding column SHALL show **In progress** (or another defined label from the Finding rules), not a permanently blank cell
