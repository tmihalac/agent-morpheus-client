# oidc-authentication Specification

## Purpose
Define how ExploitIQ maps OIDC identity-provider JWT claims to application roles across OpenShift OAuth, Keycloak, AWS Cognito (browser login and M2M), and Azure Entra ID (browser login and M2M), including non-regression guarantees for existing IdP paths.
## Requirements
### Requirement: AWS Cognito browser login role mapping

`RoleMappingAugmentor` SHALL extract application roles from the `cognito:groups` claim (a JSON array of group names) on the identity's JWT, in addition to the existing `groups` (OpenShift), `realm_access.roles`/`resource_access.{client-id}.roles` (Keycloak), and Kubernetes service-account (`kubernetes.io`) claim checks. For each value in `cognito:groups` that matches a configured target role (`quarkus.http.auth.policy.role-policy.roles-allowed`), the augmentor SHALL grant that role to the identity, without duplicating roles already granted by another claim path. This claim check SHALL run unconditionally alongside the existing checks on every authenticated request, requiring no new Quarkus profile: the `external-idp` profile's existing `discovery-enabled=true`, `roles.source=accesstoken`, and `application-type=hybrid` settings SHALL work unmodified against a Cognito User Pool's `.well-known/openid-configuration`.

#### Scenario: Cognito group matching a target role is granted

- **WHEN** an authenticated request carries a JWT with `cognito:groups` containing `exploit-iq-admin`
- **AND** `exploit-iq-admin` is present in the configured target roles
- **THEN** the augmented identity is granted the `exploit-iq-admin` role

#### Scenario: Cognito group not matching any target role is ignored

- **WHEN** an authenticated request carries a JWT with `cognito:groups` containing a group name that is not in the configured target roles
- **THEN** the augmented identity is not granted a role for that group name
- **AND** no error is raised

#### Scenario: Missing cognito:groups claim does not affect other providers

- **WHEN** an authenticated request carries a JWT without a `cognito:groups` claim
- **THEN** the augmentor skips Cognito group role mapping
- **AND** continues to evaluate `groups`, `realm_access`/`resource_access`, and `kubernetes.io` claim paths unaffected

### Requirement: AWS Cognito M2M scope-to-role mapping

`RoleMappingAugmentor` SHALL support authorizing AWS Cognito `client_credentials` (M2M) bearer tokens, which carry no group claim, by mapping the token's OAuth2 `scope` claim (a space-delimited string) to application roles using a configurable `exploitiq.security.oidc.scope-role-mappings` property (a map of scope value to role name, empty by default). For each configured mapping whose scope value is present in the token's `scope` claim, the augmentor SHALL grant the mapped role, provided that role is also present in the configured target roles. This mechanism SHALL be provider-agnostic (keyed only on the standard `scope` claim), opt-in via configuration, and SHALL NOT alter role resolution for tokens where `exploitiq.security.oidc.scope-role-mappings` is unset or the `scope` claim is absent.

#### Scenario: M2M token scope matching a configured mapping is granted the mapped role

- **WHEN** an authenticated request carries a JWT with a `scope` claim containing `exploitiq-resource-server/exploitiq-api-access`
- **AND** `exploitiq.security.oidc.scope-role-mappings` maps `exploitiq-resource-server/exploitiq-api-access` to `exploitiq-api-access`
- **AND** `exploitiq-api-access` is present in the configured target roles
- **THEN** the augmented identity is granted the `exploitiq-api-access` role

#### Scenario: M2M token without a matching configured scope mapping is not granted a role

- **WHEN** an authenticated request carries a JWT with a `scope` claim that does not match any configured `exploitiq.security.oidc.scope-role-mappings` entry
- **THEN** no role is granted via scope-based mapping
- **AND** the request is still evaluated against roles granted by other claim paths

#### Scenario: Cognito M2M token is authorized to call the API

- **WHEN** the `exploit-iq-agent` service calls the `exploit-iq-client` API with a bearer token obtained from Cognito's token endpoint via `client_credentials` grant, whose `scope` claim matches a configured `exploitiq-api-access` mapping
- **THEN** the request is authorized by the global `role-policy` (which allows `exploitiq-api-access`)
- **AND** the caller identity resolves to the JWT `sub` claim (the Cognito App Client ID) for actor attribution, since no `UserInfo` is available for M2M requests

### Requirement: Azure Entra ID role mapping

`RoleMappingAugmentor` SHALL extract application roles from the top-level `roles` claim (a JSON array of app-role values) on the identity's JWT, covering both Azure Entra ID browser login (app roles assigned to users) and M2M `client_credentials` (app-only) tokens. Entra app-only tokens carry no `scope`/`scp` claim and no group-name claim, so the `roles` claim is the only authorization source for an Entra callback token. For each value in `roles` that matches a configured target role (`quarkus.http.auth.policy.role-policy.roles-allowed`), the augmentor SHALL grant that role to the identity, without duplicating roles already granted by another claim path. This claim check SHALL run on every authenticated request **only when the token issuer (`iss` claim) belongs to the Microsoft issuer family** (`login.microsoftonline.com`, `login.microsoftonline.us`, `login.partner.microsoftonline.cn`), and SHALL be a no-op for any other issuer; it requires no new Quarkus profile: the `external-idp` profile's generic OIDC discovery SHALL work unmodified against Entra's `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration`. The `iss` claim is part of the JWT signature that Quarkus OIDC verifies before the augmentor runs, so the issuer gate cannot be forged. Because the top-level `roles` claim is trusted only for Microsoft-issued tokens, a top-level `roles` claim emitted by any other provider (for example a custom Keycloak token mapper) SHALL NOT collide with the Entra path.

#### Scenario: Entra app role matching a target role is granted

- **WHEN** an authenticated request carries a Microsoft-issued JWT (`iss` in the Microsoft issuer family) with a top-level `roles` claim containing `exploit-iq-admin`
- **AND** `exploit-iq-admin` is present in the configured target roles
- **THEN** the augmented identity is granted the `exploit-iq-admin` role

#### Scenario: Entra app role not matching any target role is ignored

- **WHEN** an authenticated request carries a Microsoft-issued JWT with a top-level `roles` claim containing a value that is not in the configured target roles
- **THEN** the augmented identity is not granted a role for that value
- **AND** no error is raised

#### Scenario: Top-level `roles` claim from a non-Microsoft issuer is not mapped via the Entra path

- **WHEN** an authenticated request carries a JWT whose `iss` claim is not in the Microsoft issuer family (for example a Keycloak token with a custom top-level `roles` mapper)
- **THEN** the top-level `roles` claim is not used for role mapping
- **AND** roles are resolved only through that provider's own claim paths

#### Scenario: Entra M2M token is authorized to call the API

- **WHEN** the `exploit-iq-agent` service calls the `exploit-iq-client` API with a Microsoft-issued bearer token obtained from Entra's token endpoint via `client_credentials` grant (scope `{app-id-uri}/.default`), whose top-level `roles` claim contains `exploitiq-api-access`
- **AND** `exploitiq-api-access` is present in the configured target roles
- **THEN** the request is authorized by the global `role-policy`
- **AND** the caller identity resolves to the JWT `sub` claim for actor attribution, since no `UserInfo` is available for M2M requests

### Requirement: Existing OpenShift and Keycloak role mapping unaffected

Adding AWS Cognito and Azure Entra ID claim support SHALL NOT change role resolution behavior for OpenShift OAuth (`prod` profile, `groups`/`userinfo` roles source) or Keycloak (`external-idp`/`dev` profiles, `realm_access`/`resource_access` roles source) identities. The new `cognito:groups`, `scope`-based, and top-level `roles` checks SHALL be no-ops when their respective claims or configuration are absent.

#### Scenario: OpenShift identity unaffected by Cognito and Entra support

- **WHEN** an authenticated request carries an OpenShift JWT/UserInfo with a `groups` claim and no `cognito:groups`, matching `scope` mapping, or top-level `roles` claim
- **THEN** roles are granted exactly as before this change, via the `groups` claim path only

#### Scenario: Keycloak identity unaffected by Cognito and Entra support

- **WHEN** an authenticated request carries a Keycloak JWT with `realm_access.roles` and/or `resource_access.{client-id}.roles` and no `cognito:groups` or top-level `roles` claim
- **THEN** roles are granted exactly as before this change, via the Keycloak claim paths only
